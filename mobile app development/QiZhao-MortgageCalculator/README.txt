This app can be run at Android Studio 2.0.

No special settings are needed. Open the project using anroid studio and it should be runnable by phone or emulator.
I have checked every sizes from 3.7 inches to 7 inches for both protrait and lanscape orientations. It should be working on all the default sizes provided in the android studio.
No crash was detected by using this app. User input errors will stop the calculation and pop out a toast message of error details.

The app can be run at my Samsung Galaxy S5 with no problem.

If you have any concerns, please email me at qzhao1@scu.edu

Thank you!
